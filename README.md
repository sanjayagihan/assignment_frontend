# Front-End Overview

This project is a React-based front-end application designed to interact with a backend API, allowing users to manage a list of users. It integrates with Redux for state management, Axios for making HTTP requests, and is styled using Bootstrap.

## Key Features:
- **User Management:** Users can be added, updated, and deleted. The app allows the management of users, including their usernames, first names, last names, and roles (admin/user).
- **API Integration:** The front-end communicates with a backend API to fetch, create, update, and delete user data. Axios is used for handling HTTP requests.
- **State Management:** Redux is used for centralized state management to handle user data and authentication. A mock store is implemented for testing.
- **Responsive UI:** The user interface is built with React and Bootstrap, ensuring it is responsive and accessible on all devices.
